                The members of Muse played in separate school bands during their stay at Teignmouth Community College in the early 1990s. 
                Guitarist Matt Bellamy successfully auditioned for drummer Dominic Howard's band, Carnage Mayhem, becoming its singer 
                and songwriter. They renamed the band Gothic Plague. They asked Chris Wolstenholme – at that time the drummer 
                for Fixed Penalty – to join as bassist; he agreed and took up bass lessons.[3][4] The band was renamed Rocket Baby 
                Dolls and adopted a goth-glam image. Read more about it at
