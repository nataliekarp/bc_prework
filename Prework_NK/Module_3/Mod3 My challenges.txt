which of the challenges you think will be most difficult for you and what steps you will take to overcome these difficulties


My Challenges


First I have to pick one of the most difficult point from 12 key point to success. I have already read it several times and I found that N4 “Patience Makes Perfect” will be the most challenging one for me. October and November will be the challenging months for me.


Also I have to improve my organizational skills: Do important thing first, not Urgent!!! But not forget about health issue (walking, nutrition) and analyze day and do planning for a next day. I suppose everyday planning is a key for my success.
